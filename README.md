# This project is now deprecated
Express is now deprecated, we now moved to EliteClient that has database support (SQLite only for now), better made commands, and you won't need a Lavalink server hosted anymore. Music commands are also improved. Performance is also improved: when playing music for example, the bot is using 1% of the CPU. It also has a documentation that is work-in-progress that explains how to add your own commands (Coming soon) and so much more...

## Express

Express is a music and moderation bot with simple commands and made in discord.js

## Own instance

Heroku offers you the possibility to host your own instance of the Discord bot, you only need a brain and some requirements for the bot to work.
