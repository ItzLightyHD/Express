# We moved to [EliteClient](https://github.com/ApexieDevelopment/EliteClient)
Since Express was a mess, we moved to the development of EliteClient, a highly customisable, open source client for Discord bots written in Java. This offers so many functions like music player without Lavalink, better support and hostable everywhere (it doesn't use so much resources, even on a free/cheap hosting).

## What will happen to Express?
I won't update it anymore, and if you want to fork it, feel free to do so. However, I'd like to have credits and a link to the original source code, or else I'll strike down your bot, no matter how, I'll do it, so you know what to do.
We won't give any support for this bot.

## Why should I move to EliteClient, and how to try it?
EliteClient tries to:
- rewrite Express, but in Java (this helps the development so much), so hosting it either by yourself or by using Heroku won't be that hard
- have better support for both people who host the bot by theirselves (either self-hosting or using a VPS) and people who use services like Heroku where no database can be used
- use databases in their bots to make things like custom prefix and so much more...
- implement the newest things that the Discord API has to offer

To try the bot, you just need to click this button that will help you through deploying the bot on Heroku one of the many free services that's actually good.
